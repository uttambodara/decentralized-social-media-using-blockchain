# Decentralized Social Media - Blockchain
This project aims to create a decentralized social media platform using blockchain technology. Users will have enhanced control over their data privacy and content, while leveraging the benefits of blockchain's transparency and immutability. The project utilizes Next.js, Hardhat, and Sanity to build and deploy the application.

## Getting Started
To run the development server, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server on http://localhost:3000. You can modify the pages in the pages directory to customize the application.

API routes can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/api/hello. You can edit this endpoint in the pages/api/hello.js file.

## Learn More
To learn more about Next.js and its features, refer to the official [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs). Additionally, you can explore the interactive [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs) tutorial.

For contributions and feedback, visit the [Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js).

## Deployment on Vercel
The recommended platform for deploying Next.js apps is Vercel. To deploy your app, follow the instructions provided in the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying).

## Hardhat Project
This project includes a basic Hardhat setup for smart contract development. It features a sample contract, a test script, a deployment script, and a task implementation example. You can execute various tasks using the following commands:
```bash
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

## Sanity Content Studio
The Sanity Content Studio is integrated into the project as an open-source real-time content editing environment connected to the Sanity backend. To get started, consult the "getting started" section in the documentation and join the community Slack. You can also extend and build plugins to enhance the functionality of the Sanity Content Studio.
